            <p>At Forest Hill Bowling Club we have played Lawn Bowls since we  formed in 1894 and are one of the oldest bowls clubs in the country. We moved to our present location in 1910 and celebrated  our 125 Anniversary in 2019.  We welcome new members of all abilities and levels.<br><br>
            We are private club with a mixed membership of about 60 members. The club has a full list of friendly and league matches with a combination of men's ladies and mixed games.<br><br>
            The club is easy to get to by public transport as we are near bus routes 75 and 356 (Siddon Road stop) and  Forest Hill railway station is only half a mile away. We also have our own large car-park.  See <a>Location & Contacts.</a><br><br> 
            If you are interested in taking up a sport that helps keep you active in pleasant surroundings amongst friendly people, why don't you come along and have a go. We have three coaches who will be happy to start you off. We have spare sets of bowls  for you to use. The only special requirement is that you have flat shoes with little Tread and no heels to protect our green. You can contact the Club secretary <a>here</a> for more details  or talk to our secretary.<br><br>
            If you would like to look around the club and talk to club members, then some of our members who maintain the Gardens on  Tuesdays and Thursdays throughout the year, would be pleased to talk to you about the Club or bowls and show you the grounds and Club House.<br><br>
